<h1>Siberian Husky </h1>

<div class="text">
	<p> Siberian huskies are very friendly and intelligent. They are more suited for cooler climates. Huskies tend to shed a lot in warmer areas. Huskies tend to howl, however they do not bark and will not alert you to an intruder. Huskies are dogs that require a strong alpha type owner. They are not dogs for timid or first time owners. An average male stands between 21 and 23.5 inches high while the female averages 20 to 22 inches. The male weighs between 45 and 60 pounds and the female 35 to 50 pounds. </p>

	<p> Due to their breeding and history, Huskies do not require very much food. This is because huskies are native to the Arctic, and food is hard to find. This may make Huskies seem like easy dogs to take care of however, this is untrue. Huskies are dogs that require a lot of attention and they are masters of escape. </p>
